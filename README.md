## Usage
Run the setup file and the application will install, and appear in the system tray.
Access the application's primary function by pressing the "superpaste" autofill hotkey: CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+V 

In the context menu, you will find the password manager UI, the option to change your master password, and also you can choose to start the application at windows startup from the context menu option.
