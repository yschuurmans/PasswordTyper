# PasswordTyper
For those games and applications that regularly require you to type in your password, but you really don't want to.


## Features
- Quickly and easily type your complex passwords.
- Generate and auto-type your TOTP codes.
- Ideal for games and applications that don't support "remember me" functionality or where it doesn't work well.
